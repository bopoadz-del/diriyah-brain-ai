# Diriyah Brain AI – Feature Set Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the requested features for the Diriyah Brain AI project, indicating which features are currently implemented (or mocked) and which would require further development.

## 🔹 Core Chat Assistant

- **ChatGPT-style interface (English + Arabic):** ✅ **Implemented.** The UI supports both languages with RTL text direction.
- **Voice input 🎤 + Arabic speech recognition:** ✅ **Partially Implemented.** The UI has a voice input button that uses the browser's Web Speech API. Full cross-browser support and advanced features would require a dedicated speech-to-text service.
- **In-chat alerts ⚠️ instead of dashboards:** ✅ **Implemented.** The chat interface can display alert-style messages.
- **Export chats as PDF / Excel / MoM reports:** ✅ **Partially Implemented.** The UI has an "Export PDF" button that currently exports the chat as a text file. Generating formatted PDFs, Excel files, or MoM reports would require dedicated backend logic.

## 🔹 Document & Data Integration

- **Google Drive / OneDrive → project documents:** ✅ **Partially Implemented.** The backend has a mock Google Drive adapter. Real integration would require OAuth 2.0 setup and use of the Google Drive API.
- **Aconex → pull correspondence, transmittals, RFIs, submittals:** ❌ **Not Implemented.** Requires Aconex API access and development of an adapter.
- **Primavera P6 → live schedule integration:** ❌ **Not Implemented.** Requires Primavera P6 API access and development of an adapter.
- **Power BI → link charts & reports:** ❌ **Not Implemented.** Requires Power BI API access and development of an adapter.
- **BIM Models (Revit, Navisworks, IFC):** ❌ **Not Implemented.** Requires specialized libraries (e.g., Autodesk Forge, IfcOpenShell) and significant development effort.
- **AutoCAD drawings → read PDFs/DWG for dimensions & quantities:** ❌ **Not Implemented.** Requires specialized libraries and would be a complex R&D effort.

## 🔹 AI-Enhanced Analysis

- **Quantity take-off (QTO):** ❌ **Not Implemented.** This is a highly complex feature that would require significant AI model development and integration with BIM/CAD data sources.
- **Schedule alerts:** ❌ **Not Implemented.** Requires integration with a scheduling tool like Primavera P6.
- **Cost control:** ❌ **Not Implemented.** Requires integration with financial systems and cost management software.

## 🔹 Visual & Media Integration

- **Photo/Video ingestion:** ✅ **Partially Implemented.** The frontend allows photo uploads, and the backend has a placeholder for analysis. Real analysis would require computer vision models.
- **Drone integration:** ❌ **Not Implemented.** Requires a drone data provider and specialized geospatial analysis tools.
- **Computer vision QA:** ❌ **Not Implemented.** This is a highly complex feature that would require significant AI model development.

---

## 🔹 Collaboration & Communication

- **WhatsApp/Teams workgroup integration:** ❌ **Not Implemented.** Requires WhatsApp Business API and Microsoft Teams API access and development of adapters.
- **Email/Outlook sync:** ❌ **Not Implemented.** Requires Microsoft Graph API or similar and development of an adapter.

---

## 🔹 Compliance & Governance

- **Insurance & bond monitoring:** ❌ **Not Implemented.** Requires integration with financial/legal systems and document analysis capabilities.
- **Contract alignment:** ❌ **Not Implemented.** Requires advanced NLP and document comparison capabilities.
- **Regulation tracking:** ❌ **Not Implemented.** Requires a database of regulations and advanced NLP for document analysis.

## Summary

We have built a strong foundation with the core chat assistant and a flexible, role-based architecture. The system is ready for integration with real data sources and more advanced AI capabilities. The next steps would involve prioritizing the desired features and tackling the integration and development work for each.
